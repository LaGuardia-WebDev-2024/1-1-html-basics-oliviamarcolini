    <h1> Francis Forever  </h1>
  
<h3> By Mitski </h3>
 
  <p>
    I don't know what to do without <em>you</em><br>
I don't know where to put my hands<br>
I've been trying to lay my head down<br>
But I'm writing this at three AM<br>
<p>
  
  </p>I don't need the world to see<br>
That I've been the best I can be, but<br>
I don't think I could stand to be<br>
<strong>Where <em>you</em> don't see <em>me</em></strong>
<p>
  
  </p>On sunny days I go out walking<br>
I end up on a tree-lined street<br>
I look up at the gaps of sunlight<br>
<strong>I miss you more than <em>anything</em></strong>
<p>
  
  </p>I don't need the world to see<br>
That I've been the best I can be, but<br>
I don't think I could stand to be<br>
<strong>Where <em>you</em> don't see <em>me</em></strong>
<p>
  
  </p>And autumn comes when you're not yet done<br>
With the summer passing by, but<br>
I don't think I could stand to be<br>
<strong>Where <em>you</em> don't see <em>me</em></strong>
  </p>
